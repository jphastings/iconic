Short URLs you can speak
------------------------

I used to get really frustrated giving web addresses to my friends. URLs are simple to speak if they're basic ("go to github.com") but what happens if you want to give someone directions to a particular reddit comment? Or a photo on facebook?

You could use a URL shortener, like http://goo.gl, but the resulting URL isn't very easy to speak: http://goo.gl/D12Gs "goo dot gee ell forward slash capital dee, one, two capital gee lower case ess"

The alternative is [iconic](http://iconic.im). Red Heart, Brown Hat. Try it and see.

If you think you can make an improvement, feel free to fork and submit a pull request. I'll fold in anything that improves the service and will keep an eye on the issues tracker here too (though I'm very short of free time these days!)

Let me know if you find this useful :)

Cheers,
